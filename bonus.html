		Seventeen is known as one of the top self-producing boy bands since the members are involved in the creative music process and choreography. Though Seventeen has 13 members, their name comes from the equation, “13 members + 3 units + 1 Team = Seventeen.” Their fans, known as CARATs, shower them with shining diamond love ever since their debut.
